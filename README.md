# Poring

> [!WARNING]  
> Work in progress. Rough edges and no documentation.

Minimalistic vanilla JavaScript rendering library that is short and easy to read. [Go read it](./src/lib/poring.js).

Thanks to its nature, you don't need to trust a compiled, bundled and minified version of the library. Just copy the [single file you've already read](./src/lib/poring.js) into your project and you're done.

Reactivity is based on Signals. Produces [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements).
